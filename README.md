# TextEditingReference
A non-curated collection of tools for working with text on Apple platforms

This exists to try to encourage collaboration, reduce redundant work, and generally help those working with text make better stuff. It is a list of libraries, packages, and tools geared towards people working with text on Apple platforms. Inclusion is **strictly** non-curated. I will not apply any filters to the listings here. But, just to be extra-clear is a list of **infrastructure**, not apps.
